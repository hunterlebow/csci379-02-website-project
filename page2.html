      <h1>Accessibility Report</h1>
      <h2>Statement of Accessibility</h2>
      <p>
        Web Designers should be commited to providing an accessible experience
        for all users, which was the design in mind for this website. This site
        follows the best accessibility practices so that it is usable by people
        with various disabilities and assitive technologies.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Explicit Practices Used to Design and Develop an Accessible Web Page
      </h4>
      <p>
        1. Semantic HTML5: This website uses semantic HTML5 elements to provide
        a clear structure and meaning to content displayed. </br>
        2. Alt text for images: This website includes descriptive alt text for non-decorative
        images to make them accessible for screen reader users. </br>
        3. Keyboard accessibility: This website ensures that all interactive elements are
        keyboard accessible and have a visible focus indicator.
      </p>
      <h2>Accessibility in Everyday Technology</h2>
      <p>Most modern web browsers include a built-in zoom functionality that allows users to increase or decrease the size of the content on the screen.  The feature can be accessed through the browser's settings.  The keyboard shortcut for this setting is Ctrl "+" to zoom in, and Ctrl "-" to zoom out on Windows machines.  Similarly on macOS, this keyboard shortcut can be accessed using Cmd "+" to zoom in, and Cmd "-" to zoom out.</p>
      <h2>Website Evaluation Summary</h2>
      <h4>Making the Case for Accessibility for Evaluated Web Application</h4>
      <p>Here is why accessibility is important in web development.  First, it helps provide an inclusive experience for all users.  Consequently, more users are able to use your website if it is accessible.  Second, it can boost the website's search engine ranking, as search engines like Google Chrome prioritize accessible content.  Finally, implementing accessibility measures can help avoid potential legal issues arising for non-compliance with accessibility standards like the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).</p>
      <h4>Summary of Findings</h4>
      <p>Upon evaluating this website, it follows most of the accessibility guidelines.  This website demonstrates the use of semantic elements, alt text for images, and proper navigation links.  However, there are a couple of areas where improvements can be made to enhance the overall accessibility of this website.  It is also important to note that including as many accessibility rules as possible is always good thing, but it is difficult to have a perfectly accessible website because accessibility needs are different for every user.</p>
      <h4>2 Examples of Failures Found</h4>
      <p>Scalable font sizing: Using relative units like 'em' or 'rem' in web design can help users who need to scale the text size in their browser.  The styling (CSS) on this website uses fixed font sizes.  (failure)  </p>
      <p>Multimedia accessibility:  This website includes an embedded video on the home page.  To make multimedia accessible, it is important to provide captions and transcripts for audio and video content, per WCAG guidelines.  This is especially important for users who are deaf or hard of hearing.  The embedded video on this website does not include an audio transcript (failure).</p>
      <h4>Demonstrated Use of Automated & Manual Testing</h4>
      <p>WAVE and axe are two automated accessibility checkers that help to identify potential accessibility issues like the ones previously mentioned with this website.  In addition, manual testing was conducted using keyboard navigation and screen reader testing (macOS VoiceOver), to identify potential issues that the automated tools could have missed.</p>
      <h2>Tips for Novices Evaluating a Website</h2>
      <p>Start by using automated accessibility checkers like WAVE or axe to identify common issues.  Then, testing the website manually using a screen reader and keyboard navigation can help to identify additional issues and ensure a smooth experience for all users.</p></br>
      <p>WCAG has extensive guidelines and documentation and is always a good starting point when evaluating a website for its overall accessibility.</p></br>
      <p>Manual testing can be time consuming and may require learning to use the underlying assistive technology that a website is designed to accomodate (like screen readers and keyboard navigation).  To add, filing a full WCAG accessiblity report can be time consuming because it is important to understand each of the 50 guidelines in order to accurately evaluate a website</p>
